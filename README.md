# 중앙대 오늘 뭐먹지 ?

2016년 초 레일즈 처음 공부할 때 엉망으로 만들던 코드를 전부 교체함.

### Things I have covered:

* Ajax load

* Polymorphic comments

* Generating seed data

* Combining two different models through one controller

### Things I have not covered yet:

* Mobile floating menu for Chatting/Contact options

* Search bar with auto complete functionality. (Name / Like counts / Coupon)

* Right to go add form if no data found

* 'Like' action for comments and pub/rest ( also sorting based on it )

* Show shop details by drop down via partial: 'information'

* File upload via paperclip. + slider view in _information.html.erb

* Map attribute and map button to call 3rd party Map app API

* Live chatting function by Action Cable

* Implement Google AdSense

### Unsolved Bugs that need to be fixed:

* Error on the last section of comment lists ( some odd comment appears )
